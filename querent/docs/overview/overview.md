# Introduction

**R!AN** (Real-Time Information Aggregator Network) is a data fabric computing platform engineered to empower enterprises and individuals to create a semantic data fabric from their domain-specific data. With a focus on scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, R!AN transforms the way data from disparate sources are processed, analyzed, and visualized, enabling critical reasoning and insight generation.

Built on the principles of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN), R!AN excels at extracting structured knowledge—such as semantic triples (subject-predicate-object)—using a streamlined, attention-based architecture optimized for real-time applications.

_Current stable version: v1.0.1_
