**RIAN** (Real-Time Information Aggregation Network) is a semantic graph computing platform designed to empower enterprises and individuals to create a semantic data fabric from their domain-specific data to perform critical reasoning. With a focus on scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, **RIAN** transforms the way we process, analyze, and visualize complex data relationships.

## Why RIAN Stands Out


- **Semantic Data Fabric:** At the core of **RIAN** is its ability to construct a semantic data fabric. By transforming private data into knowledge vectors, **RIAN** creates a web of interconnected data points that enhance context and usability. These vectors act as precise pointers to pieces of knowledge, enabling deeper understanding and more effective data utilization.

- **Attention-Based Graph Embeddings:** Leveraging the power of transformer models, **RIAN** employs attention mechanisms to identify and extract meaningful relationships between entities. This results in a comprehensive and contextually rich search space, making it easier to uncover significant connections within the data.

- **Decoupled Compute and Storage:** **RIAN** is built for unparalleled scalability and resource efficiency. Its decoupled architecture means that computations are executed directly on distributed cloud storage, eliminating the need to move data around. This design allows for seamless scaling to petabytes of data with minimal operational overhead.

- **Ingesting Data from Multiple Sources:** Flexibility is key with **RIAN**'s robust data ingestion capabilities. Users can efficiently pull data from a variety of sources, enabling organizations to adapt to evolving data schemas and extract value from diverse datasets without compromising performance.

- **Real-time Data Processing:** **RIAN** supports both real-time event streaming and batch processing. This capability ensures that organizations can derive insights from streaming data sources and historical datasets alike, providing timely and actionable intelligence.

- **Semantic Search:** With **RIAN**, organizations can perform powerful semantic searches across their data fabric. This facilitates new knowledge discovery by allowing users to traverse and query the interconnected data space efficiently.

- **Insight Generation:** Ultimately, **RIAN** empowers users to reason over their private data, generating actionable insights and enabling informed decision-making. The platform's comprehensive approach to data processing and analysis ensures that critical information is always within reach.

## Methodology: Attention-Based Graph Embeddings

**RIAN** utilizes attention mechanisms in transformer models to identify and extract meaningful relationships between entities within the same sequence of tokens:

- **Attention-Based Relationships:** Attention weights reveal the strength of relationships between entities, helping identify the most significant connections within the data.
- **Build Knowledge Graphs:** These relationships underpin our knowledge graph, forming a comprehensive and contextually rich search space for more effective data exploration and insight generation.

## Knowledge Representation

Adjust the importance of embeddings (for Head Entity, Tail Entity, and Sentences/Context) by applying a bias to create a unique, precise, and comprehensive representation. This approach ensures a balanced and context-aware embedding, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval and making it highly effective for extracting actionable insights from complex data.

## Architecture: Graph and Vector Approach

**RIAN** maps and analyzes relationships across heterogeneous data sources using a graph and vector approach. This architecture ensures efficient querying and knowledge retrieval by generating vector embeddings for each relationship, enabling sophisticated data analysis and insight generation.

## Results: Embedding-Based and Graph Traverser-Based
