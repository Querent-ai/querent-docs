## **Architecture Diagram**  
A visual representation of the structure and interaction of all the components within Querent, illustrating how data flows and is processed within the system.

## **Bridge**  
A component of Querent that serves as an interface between the core system and external data sources or services, enabling data exchange and integration with other systems.

## **Data Ingestion**  
The process of collecting and importing data from various sources into Querent for processing and analysis.

## **Engine**  
The core processing unit of Querent that performs semantic graph computations, including the analysis, construction, and updating of semantic graphs, as well as knowledge inference.

## **Error Handling**  
A feature within workflow management that deals with errors during data processing, including retries, error logging, and implementing recovery mechanisms.

## **Event Streamer**  
A component of the ingestion layer that handles real-time or batch streaming of data from different sources into Querent.

## **External Data Sources**  
Third-party databases, APIs, or data lakes from which Querent can fetch additional information to enrich semantic graphs.

## **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Experiment Layer**  
A layer designed for conducting experiments with graph neural networks, including model training and evaluation, to support advanced analytics and machine learning tasks.

## **Graph Processing**  
The analysis and processing of incoming data by the engine to construct and update the semantic graph, identifying and mapping relationships and entities.

## **Graph Storage**  
The component responsible for storing the semantic graph data in a scalable and durable manner, ensuring data is kept in distributed storage systems or databases.

## **Indexer**  
A tool within the indexing component that creates and maintains indexes of the semantic graph, enabling fast and efficient data access and search capabilities.

## **Ingestion Layer**  
The first layer of Querent that collects data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format for further processing and analysis within the platform.

## **Knowledge Inference**  
A process conducted by the engine to derive implicit relationships or properties from the semantic graph, enriching the dataset with new insights.

## **Model Training**  
A function of the GNN experiment layer where graph neural network models are trained using graph data and labeled examples for specific tasks, such as node classification or link prediction.

## **Semantic Graph**  
A data structure used by Querent to represent and analyze data, where entities are nodes and relationships are edges, allowing for a holistic view of data relationships and insights.

## **Storage Mapper**  
Part of the ingestion layer that adapts data from different storage systems into a common schema for semantic graph processing.

## **Task Scheduling**  
A feature of workflow management that organizes the execution of data processing tasks based on their dependencies and available resources.

## **Third-Party Tools**  
External analytics, visualization, or machine learning frameworks that can integrate with Querent to enhance data analysis and insights.

## **Workflow Management**  
The component of Querent that oversees the orchestration of tasks and workflows, ensuring that data processing is executed efficiently and reliably according to predefined logic and dependencies.
