To present the event data structures in a more accessible, layman-friendly manner without delving into code or specific programming languages, we can describe them using simplified schema representations. This approach makes the information more approachable to a broader audience, including those without a technical background.

# Event Payload Descriptions

## Overview

This section provides simplified descriptions of the event data structures generated by the system. These schemas outline the essential components of each event type, making it easier to understand the kind of data being processed and stored.

## Event Types

### Vector Events

**Description:** Vector events relate to high-dimensional data points used for machine learning models and similarity searches.

**Schema:**

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the event.
- **Embeddings:** A list of floating-point numbers representing the vector in high-dimensional space.
- **Size:** The dimensionality of the vector.
- **Namespace:** A categorization or grouping label for the event.

### Graph Events

**Description:** Graph events describe the relationships between entities, ideal for mapping connections and network structures.

**Schema:**

- **Subject:** The entity from which a relationship originates.
- **Subject Type:** The classification or type of the subject entity.
- **Object:** The entity to which the relationship points.
- **Object Type:** The classification or type of the object entity.
- **Predicate:** The nature or description of the relationship between subject and object.
- **Predicate Type:** The classification of the relationship.
- **Sentence:** A textual representation or description of the relationship.

### Index Events

**Description:** Index events are structured records designed for efficient storage and retrieval, facilitating quick access to information.

**Schema:**

- Similar to traditional database records, Index events are characterized by their structured format, which includes various fields like ID, Name, Description, and Timestamp, among others. The specific fields depend on the application and the data being indexed.
