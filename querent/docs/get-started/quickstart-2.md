This guide outlines the steps on how to use R!an, including creating an index, adding documents, and executing search queries.

## Access the R!an Dashboard

Once you have started the R!an server, you can access the R!an dashboard to start creating semantic data fabric with your data.

### Steps to Access the Dashboard

1. **Start the R!an Server**

   Depending on your configuration, start the R!an server using one of the following commands:

   **With PostgreSQL:**

   ```bash
   
   rian serve --config path/to/your/node.yaml
  
  ```

  **With SurrealDB:**

   ```bash
   
   rian serve
  
  ```
2. **Navigate to the Dashboard**

  Starting a R!an server in serve mode will automatically open the dashboard in a browser tab.

## Using the R!an Dashboard

### Overview
The R!an dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing your data, including sections for Cluster Info, Node Info, Discovery, Insights, Semantic Service, and Node Health.

#### Cluster Info
Cluster Information: Provides details about the cluster, including nodes, status, and configuration.

#### Node Info
Node Details: Displays information about the current node, including its ID, status, and configuration.

#### Discovery
Service Discovery: Manages the discovery of services within the cluster.

#### Insights
Insights Management: Allows you to view and manage insights generated by the system.

#### Semantic Service
Semantic Pipelines: Runs semantic pipelines assigned by the control plane.

#### Node Health
Health Monitoring: Monitors the health and performance of the node, providing detailed metrics and status reports.

### 1. Setup up Data Sources

#### Navigate to the Semantic Service Section

#### Initialize Data Source(s)

- R!an supports a variety of data sources. For detailed information, please refer to the [data sources documentation.](..//guides/data_sources.md).

To initialize a local file folder source, use the following configuration:

```json
{
        "backend": {
        "files": {
           "root_path": "path/to/your/local/file/folder",
           "id": "File Collector 1"
          }
      },
      "name": "Demo Collector"
    }
```

In this example, we are initializing a single data source. You can add additional data sources based on your specific data locations and requirements.


### 2. Create Semantic Data Fabric

#### Start the Semantics service

To start processing the data and create a semantic data fabric over your private data, follow these steps:

The following options are customizable:

```json
{
  "attention_threshold": 0,
  "collectors": [
    "string"
  ],
  "fixed_entities": {
    "entities": [
      "string"
    ]
  },
  "model": 0,
  "sample_entities": {
    "entities": [
      "string"
    ]
  }
}

  ```
- attention_threshold: R!an uses attention matrices from transformer models to construct the semantic data fabric. This threshold filters out data fabrics that fall below the specified score.  
- collectors: A list of sources to be used for fetching data.
- fixed_entities: A list of entities around which the semantic data fabric will be constructed.
- sample_entities: The types of the entities specified in fixed_entities.
- model: Choose the model to use for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  - Pass 0 to use the English-based NER model.
  - Pass 1 to use the geology-based NER model.
  - If no model and no entities are specified, the default is the English-based NER model.


### 2. Data Fabric Enable Search and Data Discovery
