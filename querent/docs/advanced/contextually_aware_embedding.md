### Contextually Aware Embedding

Contextually aware embedding serve as semantic representation of data that captures not just the meaning of individual words or concepts but also the relationships or connections between them within a specific context. These embeddings are crucial for tasks that require understanding of these connections, such as semantic search, data fabric construction, and natural language processing applications.
Unlike traditional vector embeddings that provide general representations of words or sentences, **contextually aware embeddings** are designed to capture and link data points along with their attributes between concepts. 


### Creation Process

The process of creating contextually aware embedding is a multi-step process:

1. **Sentence Embedding**: Initially, a sentence embedding is generated, representing the overall context of the sentence.

2. **Concept Embedding**: Embeddings are also created for key concepts identified within the sentence.

3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Attention scores are calculated using transformers, such as BERT, to determine the importance of each concept within the context of the sentence. These scores highlight which parts of the sentence contribute most to understanding the connections between concepts.

4. **Biasing the Embedding**: The sentence embedding is then adjusted by incorporating the embeddings of the concepts, weighted by their respective attention scores. This ensures that the final embedding captures not only the general context but also emphasizes the most relevant connections within the sentence.

### Application in Semantic Data Fabric

1. **Enhanced Semantic Understanding**: 
   By capturing the relationships between concepts within a context, these embeddings provide a more refined semantic understanding of the data, making them ideal for applications like semantic search and information retrieval.

2. **Reduced Noise**: 
   By focusing on the context, these embeddings filter out irrelevant information, reducing noise and increasing the precision of the search results.
  
3. **Context-Rich Search Space**:
   When performing natural language searches, these embeddings help retrieve documents or data points that are conceptually related to the query.
  
4. **Versatility Across Domains**:
   These embeddings can be applied in various domains, such as geology, finance or any other field, where they help detect hidden patterns and provide comprehensive context across disparate data sources.
